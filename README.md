# JavaScript na Web: Armazenando Dados no Navegador

This repository aims to document my studies and progress in the "JavaScript on the Web: Storing Data in the Browser" course on the Alura platform. It contains the source code of the Travel Backpack project, developed during the course. Its goal is to demonstrate techniques for storing data in the browser using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The files included in this repository are the source code of the application and this README file which explains about the project and the course's objective.


## Course Content

- Module 1: Data Manipulation on the Web
- Module 2: Storing Data on the Web
- Module 3: Interacting with Data on the Web
- Module 4: Updating Items with JavaScript
- Module 5: Removing Items with JavaScript


## Project Description

The Travel Backpack application is a simple tool to help users plan their trips by allowing them to keep track of items that can't be forgotten. The application allows for adding, updating and removing items from a list with a clean design. Data is persistent, allowing the user to access the list at any time, even after reloading the page. This ensures that the necessary items for the trip will always be available to the user, making the trip preparation easier.
